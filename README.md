# Machine Learning Models for HIV Outbreaks

Code from _Kupperman et al._ "A deep learning approach to real-time HIV outbreak detection using genetic data".

This repository is organized into two directories. 
* The `Python` module contains all Python codes for handling the deep learning and data analysis.
* The `HIV_simulator` module contains all R codes to simulate an HIV outbreak.
